Founded in 1945 and headquartered in Lisbon, it serves as a key connector between Europe, Africa, North America, and South America, with a strong focus on routes to Brazil and other Lusophone countries.\n\nAs a proud member of the Star Alliance since 2005, TAP operates an average of around 2,500 weekly flights to over 85–90 destinations in dozens of countries. Its main hub is Lisbon Humberto Delgado Airport, with secondary hubs in Porto and Madeira (Funchal).\n\nThe airline boasts a modern, primarily all-Airbus fleet of approximately 100–101 aircraft (including TAP Express regional operations), with a few additional planes on order. Key models include the fuel-efficient Airbus A330-900neo (for long-haul, with lie-flat business class seats and enhanced comfort), A321neo/LR (great for transatlantic efficiency), and the A320 family for short/medium-haul routes. The average fleet age is currently around 10.9 years (as of early 2026), reflecting ongoing modernization efforts that have kept the fleet relatively young and eco-friendly compared to many legacy carriers.\n\nTAP is well-known for its competitive pricing on transatlantic flights, comfortable seating (including Recaro seats in many cabins for better recline and adjustable headrests), a solid in-flight entertainment selection, and the popular Portugal Stopover program, which lets passengers add a free multi-day visit to Lisbon or Porto on qualifying international tickets.\n\nOverall, TAP Air Portugal combines Portuguese hospitality with reliable service, making it a go-to choice for affordable yet comfortable travel across the Atlantic and beyond!",

Operating alongside its sister company SATA Air Açores, it serves as the primary gateway connecting the nine Azores islands to mainland Portugal, Europe, North America, and selected other destinations.\nAs part of the SATA Group (founded in 1941), Azores Airlines focuses on longer-haul routes with a modern fleet of around 9 Airbus A320-family aircraft (including A320neo, A321neo, and A321LR models), offering fuel-efficient operations and comfortable transatlantic travel. The airline is well-known for its direct links from Ponta Delgada (São Miguel) to cities such as Lisbon, Porto, Faro, Boston, Toronto, New York, and several European hubs like Madrid, Barcelona, and London.\nAzores Airlines stands out for its competitive fares on North Atlantic routes, reliable service with a Portuguese touch, and strong emphasis on connecting the Azores diaspora and tourism markets. It complements SATA Air Açores (which handles short inter-island hops with turboprop Dash 8 aircraft), creating a seamless network that supports both local mobility within the archipelago and global access to the islands.\nTogether, the two carriers operate over 800 weekly flights to/from the Azores in peak summer periods, making them essential for the region's economy, tourism, and connectivity. Azores Airlines delivers a practical, value-driven flying experience ideal for travelers heading to or from this unique mid-Atlantic destination.",

They often occur downwind of mountains (lee side) and can persist for long distances. In aviation, they produce clear air turbulence (CAT) at cruising altitudes, even in cloud-free skies. Typical locations: Downwind of major ranges like the Rockies, Alps, Andes, or Sierra Nevada. Max intensity: Rotor clouds or severe turbulence with vertical gusts exceeding 2–4g in extreme cases; wave crests can reach 40,000+ ft. Effects on body: Sudden, unpredictable jolts or drops cause fear, muscle bracing, nausea (worse if prone to motion sickness), potential minor injuries if unbelted, and increased stress or fatigue from repeated bumps. What to do: Keep your seatbelt fastened whenever seated (especially on routes over or near mountains—turbulence can be severe without warning); sit over the wings for reduced motion amplitude; if you feel severe shaking, brace by placing hands on armrests or headrest and keep feet flat; avoid standing or using lavatories during known mountain wave areas; inform flight attendants if you experience pain or distress—they can request altitude changes or route deviations when safe.",

    "title": "Fume Events (Cabin Air Contamination)",
    "text": "Occasional incidents where engine oil, hydraulic fluid or fuel leaks into the bleed air system and enters the cabin through the environmental control system (ECS). This can produce a visible haze, acrid “dirty socks” or chemical odour, and sometimes eye/respiratory irritation. Most common during engine start, taxi, take-off, climb, or descent when bleed air demand is high. Typical frequency: Rare on modern aircraft (estimated 1 in 2,000–22,000 flights depending on reporting and aircraft type), though under-reporting is believed to occur. Effects on body: Short-term exposure can cause immediate symptoms such as stinging or burning eyes, nasal irritation, sore throat, coughing, headache, dizziness, nausea, metallic taste, or skin tingling. In sensitive individuals or with higher exposure: fatigue, difficulty concentrating, flu-like symptoms. Very rare severe cases have been linked to longer-lasting neurological complaints (controversial and not universally accepted). What to do: If you smell an unusual chemical odour or see haze and feel irritation, immediately inform a flight attendant—they are trained to assess and report fume events. Ask for fresh air (open gasper vents fully), breathe through a cloth or sleeve if possible, and request to move to another seat if the smell is localised. Stay calm—most events are brief and resolve quickly once the source stops or recirculation is adjusted. Drink water to help clear throat and nose. After landing, report symptoms to ground staff or seek medical attention if you experience persistent headache, dizziness, breathing difficulty, or neurological symptoms. If you are particularly sensitive (history of chemical sensitivity, asthma, migraines), consider wearing a well-fitting N95 or similar mask during boarding/taxi phases on aircraft known to have had prior issues (though this is rarely necessary). Airlines are required to investigate reported events and many now use improved seals, sensors, and bleed air filtration upgrades on newer fleets.",

    "title": "How does an Aircraft Fly?",
    "text": "An airplane flies because four main forces act on it: lift, weight, thrust, and drag.\nWeight pulls the plane down because of gravity.\nThrust pushes the plane forward. Engines (jet engines or propellers) create thrust.\nDrag is the air resistance that tries to slow the plane down.\nLift is the upward force that overcomes weight and keeps the plane in the air.\nThe wings create most of the lift. A wing has a special shape called an airfoil: curved on top and flatter (or less curved) on the bottom.\nWhen the plane moves forward, air flows over and under the wing.\nAir going over the curved top has to travel a longer path, so it moves faster than the air underneath.\nAccording to Bernoulli's principle, faster-moving air has lower pressure.\nSo pressure above the wing is lower than pressure below the wing.\nThis pressure difference pushes the wing upward — that is lift.\nAt the same time, the wing tilts slightly (angle of attack) and deflects a large amount of air downward.\nBy Newton's third law (every action has an equal and opposite reaction), when the wing pushes air down, the air pushes the wing up. This also creates lift.\nBoth explanations describe the same thing: the shape and angle of the wing make the air produce an upward force.\nFor steady level flight, lift equals weight, and thrust equals drag.\nTo take off or climb, the pilot increases thrust (more engine power) and raises the nose (higher angle of attack) so lift becomes greater than weight.\nTo land or slow down, lift is reduced (lower speed, flaps extended, nose down) and drag is increased.\nFlaps and slats on the wings change the shape to create more lift at low speeds during takeoff and landing.\nThe engines keep providing thrust to move the plane fast enough for the wings to generate sufficient lift.\nIn simple terms: engines push the plane forward → wings push air down and create lower pressure on top → lift holds the plane up → the plane flies.",

    "text": "A turbofan engine is the main jet engine used on modern airliners. It has a large fan at the front and a smaller jet core inside.\nAir comes in through the spinning front fan.\nThe fan pushes most of the air (70–90%) straight out the back through the outer duct. This bypass air creates most of the thrust.\nA smaller amount of air goes into the core.\nIn the core the air gets squeezed tight by compressors.\nFuel is added and burned, making very hot high-pressure gas.\nThe hot gas rushes out through turbines, spinning them.\nThe turbines turn the compressors and the big front fan with a shaft.\nThe hot exhaust from the core shoots out the back, adding extra thrust.\nThis design moves a lot of air at moderate speed, which is more efficient, uses less fuel, and is quieter than old pure jet engines.\nHigh-bypass turbofans (ratio 8–12) are best for airliners because they give good power for cruising long distances with low fuel burn.\nIn short: the big fan blasts most air backward for main thrust, while the core burns fuel to spin the fan and add hot exhaust thrust. This makes the engine powerful, economical, and much quieter.",

    "text": "A turboprop engine is a type of jet engine that powers a propeller instead of producing jet thrust directly. It's used on many regional planes, cargo aircraft, and short-haul flights.\nSimple how it works:\nAir enters the front intake and flows into the gas turbine core.\nIn the core the air is squeezed tight by compressor blades.\nFuel is injected and burned, creating hot high-pressure gas.\nThe hot gas expands and rushes through the turbine blades, spinning them at very high speed.\nA shaft connects the turbine to a gearbox at the front of the engine.\nThe gearbox reduces the turbine's high speed to a suitable level for the large propeller.\nThe spinning propeller pulls a huge amount of air backward, creating most of the thrust to move the plane forward.\nA small extra thrust comes from the hot exhaust jet shooting out the back.\nWhy it's good: The big propeller moves a lot of air at relatively low speed, which is very efficient for slower speeds (up to around 400–500 mph) and gives excellent takeoff and climb performance on short runways. It burns much less fuel than pure jet engines on short routes.\nIn short: The core burns fuel to spin a turbine, the turbine drives a gearbox through a shaft, the gearbox turns a big propeller, and the propeller pulls the plane through the air like a powerful fan. This makes turboprops fuel-efficient, reliable, and ideal for regional and shorter flights.",

    "text": "Pico, dominated by Portugal's highest peak, delivers dramatic volcanic scenery, ancient vineyards, and a sense of raw adventure that sets it apart. Mount Pico rises imposingly to 2,351 meters, challenging hikers with a steep but rewarding ascent to the summit and Piquinho crater for sunrise views over the archipelago on clear days—guided night climbs add extra magic. The island's UNESCO-listed vineyard landscape features unique currais of black lava stone protecting vines from salty winds, producing crisp white wines best tasted at local wineries or the Museu do Vinho in Madalena. Explore Gruta das Torres, Europe's longest lava tube, on guided tours through its vast underground galleries formed by ancient eruptions. Whale and dolphin watching from Lajes do Pico or Madalena often yields spectacular sightings in the channel between Pico and Faial, while natural pools and black-sand beaches provide spots to unwind. Visit the Museu dos Baleeiros to learn about the island's whaling heritage, now turned to conservation, and wander charming villages like São Roque do Pico or savor fresh seafood in seaside eateries. Pico's rugged, windswept beauty rewards those seeking both adrenaline and tranquility amid its vineyards, mountains, and endless ocean horizons.",
